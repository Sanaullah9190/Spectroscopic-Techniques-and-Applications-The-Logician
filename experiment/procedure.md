## **Spectroscopic Techniques and Applications**

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. Different spectroscopic techniques are used to identify and analyze chemical compounds based on how they absorb or emit radiation.

### **1. UV-Visible Spectroscopy (Ultraviolet-Visible)**

#### **Principle:**

* UV-Vis spectroscopy is based on the absorption of ultraviolet (200–400 nm) and visible (400–800 nm) light by molecules.
* Electrons in molecules absorb energy and transition from a lower energy level (usually bonding or non-bonding orbitals) to a higher energy level (antibonding orbitals).

#### **Procedure:**

1. Prepare the sample in a suitable solvent.
2. Place the sample in a cuvette (transparent container).
3. Insert the cuvette in the spectrophotometer.
4. The instrument scans across UV/visible wavelengths.
5. Measure absorbance as a function of wavelength.

#### **Simple Applications:**

* Determine conjugation in organic compounds.
* Quantitative analysis (Beer-Lambert law).
* Identification of compounds by λmax (maximum absorption wavelength).
* Monitor reaction progress.

### **2. IR Spectroscopy (Infrared)**

#### **Principle:**

* IR spectroscopy is based on the absorption of infrared radiation (typically 4000–400 cm⁻¹).
* Molecules absorb IR radiation causing vibrations (stretching, bending) in chemical bonds.

#### **Procedure:**

1. Prepare the sample (solid, liquid, or gas).
2. Place the sample in the IR spectrophotometer.
3. Pass IR radiation through the sample.
4. Measure the absorption at various wavelengths.
5. Generate an IR spectrum showing absorption peaks.

#### **Simple Applications:**

* Identify functional groups (OH, NH, CO, etc.).
* Determine molecular structure.
* Confirm the purity of a compound.
* Study hydrogen bonding.

### **3. NMR Spectroscopy (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)**

#### **Principle:**

* NMR is based on the absorption of radiofrequency radiation by nuclei (like ¹H or ¹³C) in a strong magnetic field.
* Nuclei resonate at specific frequencies depending on their chemical environment.

#### **Procedure:**

1. Dissolve the sample in a deuterated solvent (e.g., CDCl₃).
2. Place the sample in an NMR tube.
3. Insert the tube into the NMR spectrometer.
4. Apply a magnetic field and radiofrequency pulse.
5. Detect and record the NMR signals (chemical shifts).

#### **Simple Applications:**

* Determine the number and types of hydrogen/carbon atoms.
* Elucidate molecular structure.
* Identify isomers.
* Study purity and confirm compound identity.
