### Theory in here
Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. It is a vital tool in chemical analysis and structural elucidation of organic and inorganic compounds. Three widely used spectroscopic techniques are UV-Visible (UV), Infrared (IR), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Each technique provides different but complementary information about molecular structure.

🌈 1. UV-Visible Spectroscopy

Principle:
UV-Visible spectroscopy is based on the absorption of ultraviolet or visible light by molecules, leading to electronic transitions from lower energy levels (ground state) to higher energy levels (excited state). The most common transitions observed are:

π → π* (in alkenes, aromatics)

n → π* (in carbonyl groups, lone pair-containing systems)


Applications:

Detection of conjugated π systems

Analysis of transition metal complexes

Quantitative analysis using Beer-Lambert's law

🌡️ 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy

Principle:
IR spectroscopy involves the absorption of infrared light by molecules, which causes changes in their vibrational states. Each bond in a molecule vibrates at a characteristic frequency, and these vibrations result in specific absorption bands in the IR spectrum.

Types of Vibrations:

Stretching (symmetric and asymmetric)

Bending (scissoring, rocking, wagging, twisting)


Fingerprint Region:
The region between 1500–400 cm⁻¹ is known as the fingerprint region and is unique for every compound.

Applications:

Identification of functional groups (e.g., O–H, C=O, N–H)

Determination of molecular structure

Differentiation of isomers

⚛️ 3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy

Principle:
NMR spectroscopy is based on the interaction of nuclear spins (commonly of ¹H or ¹³C nuclei) with an external magnetic field. When radiofrequency (RF) radiation is applied, nuclei absorb energy and undergo transitions between nuclear spin states.
