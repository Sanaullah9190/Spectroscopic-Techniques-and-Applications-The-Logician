## **Spectroscopic Techniques and Applications**

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. Different types of spectroscopy are used to analyze the structure, composition, and properties of substances.

---

### **1. UV Spectroscopy (Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy)**

#### **Elementary Idea:**

* UV spectroscopy involves the absorption of ultraviolet (200–400 nm) and visible (400–800 nm) light.
* Electrons in molecules absorb energy and get excited from lower energy molecular orbitals (like π or n) to higher energy antibonding orbitals (π\* or σ\*).
* Common transitions: **π → π**\* and **n → π**\*

#### **Simple Applications:**

* **Detection of Conjugated Compounds:** Useful in identifying compounds with conjugated double bonds (like dienes, aromatic compounds).
* **Purity Testing:** Detects impurities in drugs or chemicals.
* **Quantitative Analysis:** Beer-Lambert law helps determine concentration of solutions.
* **Structure Elucidation:** Identifies functional groups and electronic environments.

### **2. IR Spectroscopy (Infrared Spectroscopy)**

#### **Elementary Idea:**

* IR radiation (4000–400 cm⁻¹) causes **vibrational transitions** in molecules.
* Functional groups absorb characteristic IR frequencies based on bond strength and atomic mass.

#### **Simple Applications:**

* **Functional Group Identification:** Each bond (like O-H, N-H, C=O) absorbs at specific frequencies.
* **Determining Molecular Structure:** Helps identify the presence of functional groups like alcohols, ketones, amines, etc.
* **Quality Control:** Used in the pharmaceutical industry to ensure compound identity.
* **Monitoring Reactions:** Observes changes in functional groups during chemical reactions.

### **3. NMR Spectroscopy (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)**

#### **Elementary Idea:**

* NMR involves the interaction of **nuclei with spin (like ¹H or ¹³C)** in a magnetic field.
* When exposed to radiofrequency radiation, nuclei absorb energy and transition between spin states.
* The environment of each nucleus causes different **chemical shifts** (measured in ppm).

#### **Simple Applications:**

* **Structure Determination:** Reveals how atoms are connected in a molecule.
* **Identifying Hydrogen Environments:** ¹H NMR is used to study the number and type of hydrogen atoms.
* **Compound Purity:** Detects impurities or side products.
* **Quantitative Analysis:** Measures the amount of each compound in a mixture.
